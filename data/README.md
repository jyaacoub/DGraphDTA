The data comes from Davis and KIBA datasets.

These are split into 5 folds for training with 1 fold for testing. The binding affinity values are stored in file Y (pickled numpy object). And the values in the folds array in `folds/*_setting.txt` files are index values for the binding affinity value given in binding affinity matrix Y where the rows are the drugs and the columns are the protein.
